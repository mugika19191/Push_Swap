# 🔁 push_swap

> A sorting algorithm challenge where the goal is to sort a stack using a limited set of operations — fast, efficient, and minimal.

## 📘 Project Description

**push_swap** is an algorithmic project where you must sort a stack of integers using only a limited set of operations and as few moves as possible. You're given two stacks (`A` and `B`), and must sort stack `A` using only specific instructions (like push, swap, rotate) without using built-in sort functions.

This project focuses on algorithm design, optimization, and data structure manipulation.
